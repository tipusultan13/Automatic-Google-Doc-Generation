# Automatic-Google-Doc-Generation
The script is designed to handle Google Form submissions and generate personalized PDF documents. Upon form submission, it extracts the submitted data, replaces placeholders in a template document with the form values, converts the modified document to PDF, and saves it in a specified folder on Google Drive. This automation streamlines the process of creating individualized PDFs, making it useful for managing and organizing form responses.
